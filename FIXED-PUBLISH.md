# Fixed Publishing Issue! 

## What Was Wrong:
You tried to publish `@your-username/n8n-notion-advanced-node` but npm couldn't find that scoped package name.

## Fixed:
✅ Changed package name to: `n8n-notion-advanced-node-community`  
✅ No scoped package (no @ symbol) - simpler to publish  
✅ Ready to publish now!  

## Publish Now:
```bash
npm publish --tag beta --access public
```

## Install in n8n GUI:
- Settings → Community Nodes → Install
- Enter: `n8n-notion-advanced-node-community@beta`
- Click Install

## Alternative: Use Your Own npm Username
If you prefer, you can change the package name to:
```json
"name": "@YOUR-ACTUAL-NPM-USERNAME/n8n-notion-advanced-node"
```

Replace `YOUR-ACTUAL-NPM-USERNAME` with your real npm username (the one you logged in with).

## What's Next:
1. **Publish**: `npm publish --tag beta --access public`
2. **Test**: Install in n8n GUI
3. **Use**: Create workflows with AI agents
4. **Feedback**: Test all features

Your comprehensive n8n Notion Advanced node is ready to go!
