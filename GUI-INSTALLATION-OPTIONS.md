# GUI Installation Options for n8n Notion Advanced Node

## Method 1: npm + n8n Community Nodes GUI (RECOMMENDED)

### Why This is Best:
- ✅ **Pure GUI experience** - no server access needed
- ✅ **One-click installation** through n8n interface
- ✅ **Automatic updates** when you publish new versions
- ✅ **No Docker restarts** required
- ✅ **Easy to uninstall** if needed

### Quick Steps:
1. Publish to npm (see PUBLISH-TO-NPM.md)
2. In n8n: Settings → Community Nodes → Install
3. Enter package name → Install
4. Node appears automatically!

## Method 2: GitHub + n8n Community Nodes GUI

### If you prefer GitHub over npm:
1. **Push code to GitHub repository**
2. **In n8n GUI**: Settings → Community Nodes → Install
3. **Enter**: `https://github.com/your-username/n8n-notion-advanced-node`
4. **Click Install**

### Requirements:

## Method 3: Local Development Mode (For Testing)

### If you want to test before publishing:
1. **In n8n GUI**: Settings → Environments → Development
2. **Enable**: "Load nodes from local filesystem"
3. **Set path**: to your project directory
4. **Restart n8n** (still needed for this method)

## Method 4: n8n Cloud (If using hosted version)

### For n8n Cloud users:
- Only npm-published nodes are supported
